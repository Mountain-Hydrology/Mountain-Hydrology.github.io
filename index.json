As a result, mountains and highlands are often referred to as the world’s natural “water towers.” Despite this, our understanding of mountain hydrology is still very limited. Across the globe, nearly every region grapples with water-related challenges of varying degrees. Wide-spread drought, increased populations, flashier floods, and environmental requirements all strain existing water resources and their management. For example, the Colorado River basin has been overdrafted for decades. Its major reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, have been steadily declining, threatening 40 million people in the West with a water supply crisis [1]. Following the crisis, a substantial number of discussions and research initiatives have been undertaken regarding the Colorado River basin [2, 3, 4].\nThe Colorado River is not an exception in this regard. While Canada is the world’s third most water-abundant nation, the Prairies - Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba - are prone to both flooding and drought [5, 6]. Their water supply depends on how much snow collects in the Rockies – known as the region’s “water towers” - and how quickly it runs off as it melts. Warmer temperatures are causing mountain snow and ice to melt earlier, increasing the likelihood of summertime water shortages. For example, record high temperatures and a record fire season have been hitting Canada at the same time in the summer of 2023 [7]. The combination is forcing Canadians to re-engineer their relationship with wildfires and plan for a future where more wildfires are part of the new reality. Nevertheless, the precise repercussions of this combination on water resources remain inadequately understood.\nThe map above shows the difference in air temperature between May 15, 2023—one of the hottest days in the heatwave—and the 2014-2022 mean for that date.

This study demonstrates a practical predictive model for snow redistribution based on the Linear Particle Distribution (LPD) equation, which consists of snow surface diffusion, snow surface advection, and snow surface erosion components. Here, we focus on numerical model development and implementation for two-dimensional natural terrains at meter-scale resolutions with and without perforated snow fences, which has been difficult to model in a two-dimensional field. First, a selected numerical scheme was implemented in the Snow Movement Over Open Terrain for Hydrology (SMOOTH) model platform and tested by the exact solutions under a few well-defined boundary conditions. Then, to simulate snowdrifts around the snow detention structures in the middle of the computational domain, an equivalent solid snow fence concept was introduced and tested. The model was applied to several terrains in the Laramie Range, Wyoming, and at two sites on the North Slope of Alaska, where wind-induced snow redistribution plays a major role. Data from Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry were used to calibrate and validate the model. The numerical snow redistribution model effectively reproduces the observed snowdrift distributions when snow densification and snowmelt effects were minimal. The model applications illustrated that the diffusion effect generally dominated snow redistribution with limited contributions of advection and erosion effects for abrupt terrain transition and perforated object, respectively.

However, this dynamic variability is currently not well-represented in most land-surface models (LSMs). A stochastic snow model using the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) has been developed specifically for representing subgrid variability of snow. In this study, the FPE snow model was coupled into the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) LSM, which provides lower boundary conditions for the operational NOAA Rapid Refresh and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh weather prediction systems. This coupled land-surface model with subgrid snow processes is named the RUC-Stochastic Snow (SS) LSM. The performance of RUC-SS LSM and RUC LSM is analyzed in detail in initial offline single-column testing over two 13-km 13-km grid cells. The results show that RUC-SS LSM has a much better capability in estimating snow cover fraction than RUC LSM, especially during the late part of the snow-melting season. The simulated duration of the partially snow-covered period at the snow-melting stage is extended from a few days with RUC LSM to about one month with the RUC-SS LSM, thus improving prediction of surface energy budget components. For example, the latent and sensible heat fluxes and skin temperature increase gradually in the RUC-SS LSM during the transition from full coverage to snow-free conditions. In contrast, this transition happens too quickly in RUC LSM, and the energy-budget components change too abruptly. The results of RUC-SS demonstrate its capability to account for subgrid variability of snow cover and show that considering subgrid variability of snow in LSMs is important for simulating surface-atmosphere interactions.","tags":["land surface model","parameterization","snow","spatial variability","subgrid"],"title":"Single-Column Validation of a Snow Subgrid Parameterization in the Rapid Update Cycle Land-Surface Model (RUC LSM)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David D Turner"],"categories":[],"content":" PI David D Turner Organization NOAA Global Systems Laboratory Period 2020-03 to 2022-07 This project aimed to improve our understanding of the complex land-atmosphere processes and their interaction during the afternoon to evening transition (AET).

However, this information is ignored in current hydrological and weather prediction models as only the mean downward solar radiation of model grid is used. In this study, a parameterization for estimating subgrid variability of downward solar radiation from the model grid mean using high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data is proposed. This scheme considers aspect and slope effects on the subgrid variability. The advantage of this scheme is that computations are performed at the same resolution as the considered hydrological or weather prediction model, and subgrid topographic properties derived from high-resolution DEM data are used as static inputs. This proposed scheme has been verified in mountainous and flat areas, respectively. It is found that the scheme can well estimate the subgrid variability of downward solar radiation. Also, effects of the DEM resolution on the calculated subgrid variability and the spatial correlation of downward solar radiation are studied. Results show that modeled subgrid variability highly depends on the resolution of the DEM, while the spatial correlation is negligibly time dependent. The proposed scheme can be used in any hydrological and weather prediction model to estimate subgrid variability of downward solar radiation. For example, it is planned to be tested in future NOAA regional and global weather models to account for the effects of the subgrid variability of downward solar radiation on the snow model of the land-surface component.","tags":["hydrological modeling","land surface modeling","solar radiation","spatial variability","subgrid variability","topography"],"title":"A scale-aware parameterization for estimating subgrid variability of downward solar radiation using high-resolution digital elevation model data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siwei He","Noriaki Ohara","Scott N Miller"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693670495,"objectID":"f47507f7dbcc328587fd924ce6e9927d","permalink":"https://mountain-hydrology.github.io/publication/he-2019-a/","publishdate":"2023-09-02T16:01:35.270345Z","relpermalink":"/publication/he-2019-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract It is well known that snow plays an important role in land surface energy balance; however, modelling the subgrid variability of snow is still a challenge in large-scale hydrological and land surface models. High-resolution snow depth data and statistical methods can reveal some characteristics of the subgrid variability of snow depth, which can be useful in developing models for representing such subgrid variability. In this study, snow depth was measured by airborne Lidar at 0.5-m resolution over two mountainous areas in south-western Wyoming, Snowy Range and Laramie Range. To characterize subgrid snow depth spatial distribution, measured snow depth data of these two areas were meshed into 284 grids of 1-km ? 1-km. Also, nine representative grids of 1-km ? 1-km were selected for detailed analyses on the geostatistical structure and probability density function of snow depth. It was verified that land cover is one of the important factors controlling spatial variability of snow depth at the 1-km scale. Probability density functions of snow depth tend to be Gaussian distributions in the forest areas. However, they are eventually skewed as non-Gaussian distribution, largely due to the no-snow areas effect, mainly caused by snow redistribution and snow melt. Our findings show the characteristics of subgrid variability of snow depth and clarify the potential factors that need to be considered in modelling subgrid variability of snow depth.","tags":["fractal dimension","no-snow areas effect","probability density function","snow","subgrid variability","variogram"],"title":"Understanding subgrid variability of snow depth at 1-km scale using Lidar measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siwei He","Noriaki Ohara"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693670495,"objectID":"318b8905151f20f43add4a326d10cdb0","permalink":"https://mountain-hydrology.github.io/publication/he-2019/","publishdate":"2023-09-02T16:01:35.051567Z","relpermalink":"/publication/he-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract A physically based subgrid variability model for snow process using the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) approach was proposed. This FPE can express the evolution of the probability density function (PDF) of snow depth within a finite area, possibly a grid cell of distributed models or a small basin, whose shape can be irregular. The main advantage of this approach is that it does not rely on a given PDF but dynamically computes the PDF through an advection-diffusion-type equation, the FPE, which was derived from point-scale process-based governing equations. Snow depth was treated as a random variable, while the snow redistribution and snowmelt rate were treated as the sources of stochasticity. The main challenge in solving this FPE is evaluating the time-space covariances appearing in the diffusion coefficient. In this study, approximations to evaluate the covariance terms, accounting for snowmelt and snow redistribution, were proposed. The simulated results of the FPE model were validated by the measured time series of snow depth at one site and the spatial distributions of snow depth measured by ground penetrating radar and airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar). It was shown that the point-observed snow depth fell within the simulated range during most of the 2-year study period. The simulated PDFs of snow depth within the study area were similar to the observed PDFs of snow depth by ground penetrating radar and Lidar. In summary, these results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed FPE model representing the subgrid variability of snow depth.","tags":["Fokker-Planck equation","snow depth","snow modeling","spatial variability","stochastic modeling","subgrid variability"],"title":"Modeling Subgrid Variability of Snow Depth Using the Fokker-Planck Equation Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siwei He"],"categories":[],"content":" PI Siwei He Organization National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Period 2018-08 to 2020-02 This project aimed to solve the spatial variability of snow depth problem in the Earth system modeling.

A majority of previous studies used empirical and constant threshold wind speeds while the variations of atmosphere condition and snow age seem to greatly affect the snow settlement process. This study tested the hypothesis that the threshold wind speed for snow transport increases as deposition time passed since last snowfall by introducing a new formula of the threshold wind speed for snow movement. It was theoretically derived based on the sintering process modeling and the moment balance of a snow particle. Through this formula, the influences of snow particle size, temperature, and deposition time on the threshold wind speed were explicitly taken into consideration. However, two empirical parameters in the sintering process modeling remained in the new formula, and they were determined by a calibration-validation procedure using the field observed snow flux data. The snow flux and meteorological data collected at the ISAW stations (http://www.iav.ch) including large number of snow transport events during five winter seasons were used to test this formula. It was shown that the new formula qualitatively described the threshold wind speed required for the incipient motion of snow under various conditions in the natural environment of the Alps.","tags":["hydrology","modeling","sintering","snow movement","threshold wind speed"],"title":"A New Formula for Estimating the Threshold Wind Speed for Snow Movement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason Chang","Irene Garousi-Nejad","Lauren Grimley","Siwei He","Mariam Khanam","Tyler Madsen"," ..."],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693670494,"objectID":"0fcabc0084848c3839b707722fb1ad79","permalink":"https://mountain-hydrology.github.io/publication/chang-2017/","publishdate":"2023-09-02T16:01:34.829692Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chang-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ADHydro Introduction and Workflow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Irene Garousi-Nejad","Siwei He","Qicheng Tang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693670494,"objectID":"49afdbb66a79845e2ee59bc444cc2d07","permalink":"https://mountain-hydrology.github.io/publication/garousi-2017/","publishdate":"2023-09-02T16:01:34.708564Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garousi-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of coarse and high-resolution hydrologic modeling in mountainous area","type":"publication"},{"authors":["SiWei He","ZhuoTong Nan","YuTing Hou"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693670496,"objectID":"3cd5cf872c98313be270f009757c597b","permalink":"https://mountain-hydrology.github.io/publication/he-2015-a/","publishdate":"2023-09-02T16:01:35.853045Z","relpermalink":"/publication/he-2015-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Accuracy evaluation of two precipitation datasets over upper reach of Heihe River Basin, north-western China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steve Holbrook","Scott N Miller","Ginger Paige"],"categories":[],"content":" PI Steve Holbrook, Scott N Miller, Ginger Paige Organization University of Wyoming Period 2014-09 to 2017-12 The Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCEHG) was established in July 2012 with a NSF grant.
