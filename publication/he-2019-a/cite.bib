 abstract = {Abstract It is well known that snow plays an important role in land surface energy balance; however, modelling the subgrid variability of snow is still a challenge in large-scale hydrological and land surface models. High-resolution snow depth data and statistical methods can reveal some characteristics of the subgrid variability of snow depth, which can be useful in developing models for representing such subgrid variability. In this study, snow depth was measured by airborne Lidar at 0.5-m resolution over two mountainous areas in south-western Wyoming, Snowy Range and Laramie Range. To characterize subgrid snow depth spatial distribution, measured snow depth data of these two areas were meshed into 284 grids of 1-km ? 1-km. Also, nine representative grids of 1-km ? 1-km were selected for detailed analyses on the geostatistical structure and probability density function of snow depth. It was verified that land cover is one of the important factors controlling spatial variability of snow depth at the 1-km scale. Probability density functions of snow depth tend to be Gaussian distributions in the forest areas. However, they are eventually skewed as non-Gaussian distribution, largely due to the no-snow areas effect, mainly caused by snow redistribution and snow melt. Our findings show the characteristics of subgrid variability of snow depth and clarify the potential factors that need to be considered in modelling subgrid variability of snow depth.},
